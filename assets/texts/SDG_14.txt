The deterioration of coastal waters has become a global occurrence, due to pollution and coastal eutrophication (overflow of nutrients in water), where similar contributing factors to climate change can affect oceans and negatively impact marine biodiversity. It has been pointed out in 2018 that \"without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050.\"
